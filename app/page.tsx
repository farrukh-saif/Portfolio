          I recently graduated in Computer Engineering from {" "}
          <a href="https://metu.edu.tr/" target="_blank">Middle East Technical University</a>, Turkey, 
          and I'm all about making data work smarter, not harder. Data's everywhereâ€”we're practically drowning in itâ€”and I believe 
          it's all about finding the signal in the noise to unlock real value.

          My experience? I've built data collection pipelines, led a trash classification project with object detection, 
          and even created a chatbot website powered by a large language model.

        <p>
          Whether it's crafting solutions from scratch or diving deep into machine learning, I'm driven by curiosity 
          and a relentless urge to turn raw data into actionable insights. If you're into that, stick aroundâ€”there's more to explore.
