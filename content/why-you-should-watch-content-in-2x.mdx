I used to think, What's the point of watching stuff if you're not going to benefit from every piece of information, like every sentence?

Some things don't make sense until you have context.

Short attention span.

Doing is a more effective way of learning.

The brain automatically keeps forgetting unimportant stuff and has a built-in mechanism for remembering shocking, gap-filling, or interesting things.

Approach

1. Sequentially search over a list of ideas to find interesting ones.


2. Watch with purpose.
