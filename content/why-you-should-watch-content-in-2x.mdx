I used to think: *What's the point of watching stuff if you're not going to benefit from every piece of information, like every sentence?*  

But now, I'm convinced that sometimes it's better to speed it up!

## What changed my mind:  
- Some things don't make sense until you have context.  
- These days we have a short attention span so it's better to watch in 2x and miss some things than to be halfway in and forget what you were doing.  
- Doing is a more effective way of learning. Get the video over with and start doing!
- **Key Insight:** The brain automatically forgets unimportant stuff and has a built-in mechanism for remembering interesting things. As you watch the video, you're effectively sequentially searching over a list of ideas to find interesting ones.
