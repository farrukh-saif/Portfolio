Having recently moved to Canada after spending half my life in Turkey — and getting accepted into an AI specialization master’s program at UWaterloo in the SYDE department — I decided to survey the AI scene in the Great White North.

So, you just moved to Canada, or maybe you’ve been here a while and are just starting to explore AI? Either way, you're in the right place. I’ve done the digging, so you don’t have to spend days researching like I did.

A common theme here? "Everything is better in the US."

“Canada is chronically a late adopter of technology.” – Martin, President and COO of Cohere.

Canada currently ranks 8th on the [Global AI Index](https://www.tortoisemedia.com/intelligence/global-ai) (as of September 2024). Unsurprisingly, the US and China dominate the AI race, sitting comfortably in 1st and 2nd.

In most industries, companies can afford to lag, waiting for others to cut through the jungle before following the cleared path. But AI doesn’t work that way. The first to deploy gains a critical advantage — a continuous stream of data feeding back into better models, creating a compounding lead.

The saying goes, “the rich get richer,” similarly in AI, the winner keeps winning.

Now in my research I went to many different sources. Interestingly, there was only one Canadian AI company that I had heard about before diving into this topic: Cohere, An LLM for enterprise company. 

Canada does a solid job attracting global tech talent — 1.4 million of the 18 million workforce are in tech — but retaining that talent? Not so much.

Let’s break it all down.

# Canada's AI Policies, and Initiatives

## Government Strategies and Programs

<h3>
<a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/ai-strategy/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy</a>
</h3>


Launched in 2017, Canada became one of the first countries to establish a national AI strategy. The government’s goal is clear: drive the adoption of AI across various sectors. A significant part of this strategy includes establishing and now funding the country’s three national AI institutes (details about them later in this blog).

<h3>
<a href="https://cifar.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIFAR</a>
</h3>

Everyone in computer vision has heard of the CIFAR-10 dataset—if you’ve trained an image classification model, you’ve likely used it. Now, meet the creator. CIFAR recruits some of the top AI talent around the world to be CIFAR AI Chairs at the three National AI Institutes across the country.

<h3>
  <a href="https://www.scaleai.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scale AI</a>
</h3>

Scale AI is one of Canada's five Global Innovation Clusters. 

In Canada, these clusters have been supercharged with nearly $2 billion in federal government funding, matched dollar-for-dollar by industry.

# Some resources I found that are great for scouting out Canadian AI startups

<h3>
  <a href="https://www.canada.ai/directory#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canada AI</a>
</h3>

Out of 500 companies listed here, 400 have active websites. (Not all startups survive)

<h3>
  <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/responsible-use-ai/list-interested-artificial-intelligence-ai-suppliers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Government of Canada Vetted Suppliers</a>
</h3>

The Government of Canada is running a campaign to prequalify vendors for providing services to federal agencies.

While 150 companies are listed, many are global firms with operations in Canada rather than exclusively Canadian businesses.

<h3>
  <a href="https://creativedestructionlab.com/companies/?stream=artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graduates of the CDL Program</a>
</h3>

170 Companies that graduated from their Montreal or Toronto division

Was exploring Vector Institute’s webpage as I stumbled upon their sponsors and, perhaps coincidentally, or perhaps expectedly, since they’re trying to have connections with the AI world here, a lot of these companies are Canadian AI companies 

# Conclusion

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hM_h0UA7upI?start=2284&end=2330" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The vibe here is all about internships, not startups, as Andrej Karpathy points out in the linked video. There's a lack of the whole founder culture. Culture matters, and maybe it's time for that to change.

Canada's productivity growth problem is no secret — it lags behind the U.S. by nearly half, a gap that's been stubbornly persistent for years.

The good news? Canada seems to be waking up to the challenge. The web of AI institutes like Vector, Mila, and Amii, alongside ambitious government strategies and well-funded clusters like Scale AI, signals a growing recognition of AI's potential. Add to that an emerging startup ecosystem with players like Cohere, Waabi, and Ada pushing boundaries, and it’s clear there’s momentum building.

But here's the thing — momentum without direction is just noise. For AI to truly drive economic transformation, Canada must stop the talent drain. Too often, students leave universities with a "Cali or bust" mindset. That needs to shift to "Toronto or bust."

If Canada plays its cards right, this era of intelligence could be the moment it stops playing catch-up and starts leading.
